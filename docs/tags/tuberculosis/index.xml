      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 19-year-old, rural, skinny girl diagnosed with lupus erythematosus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I met and talk with her in the ward. Some of our talking are very impressive to me, both reflect environmental and social issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I take notes on her symptoms, I still want to ask more things, even if I am not supposed to do. I am always interested in how does people get disease. The lupus erythematosus, why does this disease come to her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is not only a disease in respiratory systems, it can infect many organs, for example, osseous tuberculosis, Intra-abdominal Tuberculosis and central nervous system .&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw one case of intracranial tuberculoma during my observation in Dept.TB. The patient have kind of cognitive decline, and there is several seconds delay when he answer peopleâ€™s questions, come to hospital because disability of one leg. Then he was diagnosed as intracranial tuberculosis with TB after CT and a series of serum test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
